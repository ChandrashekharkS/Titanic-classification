## Overview

The Titanic Classification project aims to build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic using data science techniques in Python. The project involves data loading, visualization, feature engineering, imputation, and model training and prediction.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Load training, test, and passenger datasets.
- **Visualization**: Visualize data to understand patterns and relationships.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to improve model performance.
- **Imputation**: Handle missing data effectively.
- **Training and Prediction**: Train machine learning models and make survival predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-classification.git
    ```
2. Change to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd titanic-classification
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Open and run the `Titanic_Classification.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or any Jupyter environment.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load data, visualize it, perform feature engineering and imputation, train the model, and make predictions.

## Dataset

The project uses three main datasets:
- **train.csv**: Training dataset containing features and survival outcomes.
- **test.csv**: Test dataset for which you need to predict survival outcomes.
- **passengers.csv**: Additional passenger information dataset.

## Steps in Experiment

### Loading Data

Load the training, test, and passenger datasets to start the analysis.

### Visualization

Visualize the data to understand the distribution and relationships between different features.

### Feature Engineering

Create new features to improve the model's ability to predict survival outcomes. This may include extracting titles from names, creating family size features, etc.

### Imputation

Handle missing data by filling in or imputing missing values using appropriate techniques.

### Training and Prediction

Train machine learning models using the prepared datasets and make predictions on the test set.

## Results

The predictions are saved in the `resultfile.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- **PassengerId**: The ID of the passenger.
- **Survived**: The prediction of survival (1 for survived, 0 for did not survive).

| PassengerId | Survived |
|-------------|----------|
| 892         | 0        |
| 893         | 1        |
| ...         | ...      |
